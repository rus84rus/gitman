***Upstart

Using Gunicorn with upstart is simple. 
In this example we will run the app “myapp” from a virtualenv. All errors will go to 
/var/log/upstart/myapp.log.

/etc/init/myapp.conf:

description "myapp"

start on (filesystem)
stop on runlevel [016]

respawn
setuid nobody
setgid nogroup
chdir /path/to/app/directory

exec /path/to/virtualenv/bin/gunicorn myapp:app
