. ~/.bashrc                                 > dot means "source"

'''The dot is equivalent to source. With . ~/.bashrc, you source your bash.
Executing the file would start a child process, execute the commands in this process, then return.
All that is done in the child process has no effect on the parent process (the bash from which you executed).
Instead, sourcing (with the dot) acts exactly as if you wrote the content of the file in the terminal. 
This is what you want. .bashrc is sourced everytime you start a bash.
If you make changes, they won't apply until you start a new bash or source manually.
